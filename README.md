Welcome to the Odisha Tourism Planner, a web application developed during the Code4Odisha hackathon. This project is designed to enhance tourism in Odisha, India, by providing an interactive planner that helps tourists explore both popular and lesser-known attractions across the state.

## Overview

The Odisha Tourism Planner is a user-friendly tool that allows tourists to create customized itineraries for their trips. Unlike other platforms, this planner goes beyond the well-known landmarks and highlights hidden gems—local stalls, restaurants, and lesser-visited places—offering an authentic experience of Odisha's rich culture and hospitality.


 Odisha is well known as a major tourism sector of India. Its long coastline, natural biodiversity , ranging from wildlife reserves , rivers , mountains, lakes,  monuments, the arts and stunning views.

 Despite having so many attributes and a countably finite number of tourists in this Gen Z era who know the actual beauty of the hidden gems that the state offers, the major challenge faced is the growth of tourism which remains unnoticed, unexplored affecting a substantial number of tourists.Thus, a well-designed planner helps the tourist to plan and organize a well-recognized and unrecognized tourist spot that can be easily accessed anywhere. 

Nowadays, we are seeing people shifting more and more towards the online competitive / gaming environment. Social media plays a major role, but it only showcases the beauty having not much fun or significance on ground. It would take something more interesting and appealing for them to take time off from their pre-occupied life and plan a trip.
