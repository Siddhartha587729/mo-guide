#### Odisha is well known as a major tourism sector of India for its long coastline, natural biodiversity , ranging from wildlife reserves , rivers ,mountains, lakes,  monuments, the arts and stunning views.  
#### Despite having so many attributes and a countably finite number of tourists in this Gen Z era who know the actual beauty of the hidden gems that the state offers, the major challenge faced is the growth of tourism which remains unnoticed, unexplored affecting a substantial number of tourists.Thus, a well-designed planner helps the tourist to plan and organize a well-recognized and unrecognized tourist spot that can be easily accessed anywhere. 
#### Nowadays, we are seeing people shifting more and more towards the online competitive / gaming environment. Social media plays a major role, but it only showcases the beauty having not much fun or significance on ground. It would take something more interesting and appealing for them to take time off from their pre-occupied life and plan a trip.
