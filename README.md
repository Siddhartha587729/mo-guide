#### Odisha is well known as a major tourism sector of India for its long coastline, natural biodiversity , ranging from wildlife reserves , rivers ,mountains, lakes,  monuments, the arts and stunning views.  
#### Despite having so many attributes and a countably finite number of tourists in this Gen Z era who know the actual beauty of the hidden gems that the state offers, the major challenge faced is the growth of tourism which remains unnoticed, unexplored affecting a substantial number of tourists.
#### Thus, a well-designed planner helps the tourist to plan and organize a well-recognized and unrecognized tourist spot that can be easily accessed anywhere. 
#### Nowadays, we are seeing people shifting more and more towards the online competitive / gaming environment. Social media plays a major role, but it only showcases the beauty having not much fun or significance on ground.
